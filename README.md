# Classification-for-Music-Genres
Machine learning course project in 2018.  
  
The project revolved around the task of identifying the music genre of songs.

The data is split into two datasets: a training data set with 4363 songs, and a test set dataset
with 6544 songs. Each song has 264 features, and there are 10 possible classes in total.
The dataset is a custom subset of the Million Song Dataset, and the labels were obtained
from AllMusic.com. For simplicity, each song has been assigned only one label that
corresponds to the most representative genre. The 10 labels are:  
1. 'Pop_Rock'
2. 'Electronic'
3. 'Rap'
4. 'Jazz'
5. 'Latin'
6. 'RnB'
7. 'International'
8. 'Country'
9. 'Reggae'
10. 'Blues'  
  
The features provided are a summary representation of the 3 main components of music:
timbre, pitch (melody and harmony) and rhythm.

The project was done in groups of two.
